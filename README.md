## Game Rules and Strategy

If you have already played slot machines or played a game on a small
plane, place a bet, and then the mechanics will seem familiar to you. To
begin with, you should analyze the goal of the game and the process of
accumulating winnings. When loading the main screen, the runway and the
plane appear on the screen. After departure, the plane takes off. The
longer the flight lasts, the greater the coefficient by which the bet
will be multiplied. The player's task is to have time to withdraw the
winnings before the plane crashes.

An accident can happen at any second. The bet amount will be cancelled
if the player does not use the withdrawal button before the accident.
The multiplier can be absolutely anything. It can be x1,2, the plane
will fall immediately, or the flight will be long, and the player will
get x100. If you're lucky, you need to check it out. If you are still
thinking about how to play the Aviator game, read about it in the next
section.
